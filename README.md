# Img-compression-kmeans-PCA
Implementing k-means algorithm and PCA for image compression and its comparison.

Implemented the K-means clustering algorithm and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using OpenCV and Python, both individually and successively for compressing 2D images. Minimized distortion by analyzing the coding rate vs. distortion trade-off for different patch sizes in the K-Means algorithm, and accomplished an overall relative size reduction of 89.2% between the original & compressed images by implementing the K-means algorithm followed by PCA.
